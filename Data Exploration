# Since Germany had the highest churn rate as per Nick's exploratory data analysis, I thought of making some charts based on the variable geography.

# This doesn't reveal much about the higher churn rate in Germany since the boxplots of agebins with respect to extimated salary is almost same for all the three countries

# A lot of outliers are present in Germany compared to the other two countries. Not sure if this has an effect in people exting though.
# Same is the case if we create a boxplot with respect to balance and credit score bins

# There doesn't seem to be much explanation with respect to the people who exited and their estimated salary
# However, the spread of "balance" of the people who exited in Germany seems to be less and is hovering around 75000 to 175000
# And this seems to be true for both the genders.
# But the number of exited people in Germany seems to be considerably higher for customers with Credit Card than without it comparing to the numbers in the other two countries

cData %>% ggplot(aes(x = IsActiveMember, fill = fct_rev(Exited))) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill")
# You are right in saying that "IsActiveMember" doesn't make much sense to me either and there isn't a proper explanation of the purpose of the variable in the dataset description as well
# I am fine with removing it from further analysis.
